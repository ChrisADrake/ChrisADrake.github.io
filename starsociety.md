# About This Project

This site sells a single product and has a link to another product on Amazon.
The second product's page was modified to hide the price on this site in case of 
sudden price changes on the Amazon listing. However, it still follows the style
of the current site. There is also a customized FAQ page with some important answers 
for customers.
