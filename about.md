 I am a fast learner starting a new career in front end web development. I do enjoy working on a team to build upon each otherâ€™s successes, yet I can also work alone and stay focused to complete tasks and projects in a timely manner.  I will continue learning more on the front end and the back end. I have been programming for more that 20 years!
