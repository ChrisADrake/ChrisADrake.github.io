# About This Project

Here is a site for a clothing retailer that has product filtering in the catalog and
a menu that can be browsed from any page. These tools are built into the theme itself, and 
it supports custom swatches from a color or image. Shopify can keep track of inventory, even
across multiple storage locations, to show what is available.
